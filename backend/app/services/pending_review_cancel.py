"""Cancel executions that are parked on a human review instead of running on a worker.

A run waiting on a HITL review or a Codex follow-up question owns no worker: its
process has already returned, so there is no in-memory cancellation handle and no
``ActiveWorkflowExecution`` row to flag. The only durable state is the pending review
request and a ``pending`` ``ExecutionHistory`` row, so cancelling means closing both.
