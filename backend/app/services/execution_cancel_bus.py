"""Cross-worker execution cancel signalling over Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY.

A cancel used to reach the worker running an execution only through
`active_workflow_executions.cancel_requested_at`, which the owning worker polls
every registry tick. That has two problems under `uvicorn --workers N`: the HTTP
request almost never lands on the worker that owns the execution, and the poll
reads the busiest table in the schema, so when that table is unreadable the stop
never arrives and the run keeps going.

`NOTIFY` does not touch the table, so it delivers the stop independently. The
database poll stays in place as the fallback for a worker that was reconnecting
when the signal fired. This mirrors `chat_task_registry`, which already solves
the same cross-worker delivery problem the same way.
